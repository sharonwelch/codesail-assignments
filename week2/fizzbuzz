# Instructions:
# Write a script that, for the numbers between 0 to 100, outputs:
  # "Fizz" if the number is a multiple of 3
  # "Buzz" if the number is a multiple of 5
  # "FizzBuzz" if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5
  # the number if it's not a multiple of 3 or 5

ary = Array(1..100)

ary.each do |x|
  if x%3 == 0 && x%5 == 0
      puts "FizzBuzz"
    elsif x%3 == 0
      puts "Fizz"
    elsif x%5 == 0
      puts "Buzz"
    else
      puts x
    end
end
